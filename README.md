## Glossary
### Mammograms
A mammogram is an X-ray picture of the breast. Doctors use a mammogram to look for early signs of breast cancer. The one shown above is called a mediolateral mammogram.

### Pectoral muscle
Pectoral muscles (colloquially referred to as "pecs") are the muscles that connect the front of the human chest with the bones of the upper arm and shoulder.

### Please refer `pectoral-segmentation.ipynb` for the complete code. I have tried to explain each step as clearly as I could.
